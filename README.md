If making any QR codes, please use the `.link` URL or some other URL redirect service that permits you to change the link destination. The `.link` domain will be updated to always redirect to the correct version.

## Background

All the styling is thanks to [Min](https://github.com/minkyngkm). She did a great job with the rough skeleton of a website that I made from a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/everyexpatinkorea/?post_id=10157280637516696). Many thanks to [Ben](https://github.com/Goblinlordx) for setting up Firebase CI and being an awesome technical advisor.
